          <h3>What is Qubit?</h3>
          <p>In classical computing, the bit is the fundamental unit of information and the basic building block of
              digital data. A bit can represent one of two states, typically denoted as 0 or 1. Electronic devices,
              such as transistors in computer circuits, are well-suited to this binary system, as they can easily build
              between two states-typically represented by high and low voltage. This binary nature makes bits a natural
              choice for encoding information in digital systems. The manipulation of bits underpins all digital
              computation and information processing in classical computers</p>

          <p>In quantum computing, the quantum bit, also called qubit, is the fundamental unit of quantum information.
              Unlike classical bits which can only exist in a definite state of either 0 or 1, a qubit has the unique
              ability to exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This property can perform more complex
              computation than classical bits. However, When measurements happen on qubits, the superposition collapses,
              and the qubit assumes a definite state of either 0 or 1. The outcome is probabilistic, introducing
              an element of uncertainty. The probabilities assigned during the superposition influence the likelihood
              of the qubit collapsing into a particular state.</p>
          <h3>What is Quantum State?</h3>
          <p>In quantum information theory, a quantum state is denoted as \(|\psi>\). The quantum state corresponding
              to 0 is represented as |0>, and the quantum state corresponding to 1 is denoted as |1>. Unlike a classical
              bit which is represented by either 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in both quantum state |0> and |1>, requiring
              a two-dimensional vector for its representation.
          </p>

          <h3>How to represent a quantum state?</h3>
          <p>
              In this representation, the first number of the vector represents the amplitude for the state |0>, and
              the other represents the amplitude for the state |1>. The computational basis states, which are the most
              common way to represent a qubit, are given by:
          </p>

          <p>\[|0> = \begin{pmatrix}
						1 \\
						0
						\end{pmatrix}
				, |1> = \begin{pmatrix}
							0\\
							1
						\end{pmatrix}\]</p>

          </p>However, a qubit can also be represented using other orthogonal vector, depending on the context.
				For example, another representation might involve: </p>

          <p>\[|0> = \begin{pmatrix}
							\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
							\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
						\end{pmatrix},

				|1> = \begin{pmatrix}
							\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
							-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
					\end{pmatrix}\]
          </p>

          <p>This representation is more complex than the first one but is sometimes useful in specific situations.
              A qubit can be described as a line superposition of two elementary orthogonal states |0> and |1>,
              capturing all ranges of quantum states. For example, an arbitrary quantum states is given by: </p>

          <p>\[
              |\psi> = \alpha|0> + \beta|1>
                    = \begin{pmatrix}
                        \alpha \\
                        \beta
                    \end{pmatrix}
              \]
          </p>

          <p>The two coordinates, \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), are known as qubit amplitudes. These amplitudes determine
              the probability of the qubit collapsing into a particular quantum state when measurement. Although the
              outcome of a measurement is not deterministic, but the total probability across all quantum states is
              certain to equal 1.
          </p>
          <p>When a qubit is measured, the probability of it yielding the quantum state |0> is given by \(|\alpha|^{2}\),
				and the probability of yielding the quantum state |1> is given by \(|\beta|^{2}\). These probabilities reflect the likelihood
				of each outcome, with the sum of \(|\alpha|^{2}\) and \(|\beta|^{2}\) being equal to 1, ensuring that all possible outcomes are account for
          </p>

          <p>\[|\alpha|^{2} + |\beta|^{2} = 1\]</p>



          <p>In a multi-qubit system, the state of the entire system is described by the combined quantum states of each individual qubit.
				The state of an n-qubit system is represented as a linear combination of basis states to all possible outcomes of qubits.
				This system's quantum state can be described by a \(2^n\) dimensional vector, where n is the number of qubits.
				Each element of this vector corresponds to a possible basis state of the system, with the entire state being a superposition of these basis states.
				For example, an arbitrary quantum state with an n-qubit system is given by: </p>
          <p>\[
					|\psi> = \begin{pmatrix}
            				\alpha_{0} \\
							\alpha_{1} \\

							\vdots \\
            				\alpha_{2^n - 1} \\
							\end{pmatrix}
				\]</p>
          <p>Here, \(\alpha_{0}\) represents the amplitude of the quantum state \(|000....000>\)(the binary representation with n bit of the number 0),
				\(\alpha_{2^n-1}\) represents the amplitude of the quantum state \(|111....111>\)(the binary representation with n bit of the number \(2^n-1\))
          </p>

          <p>In the case of a 2-qubit system, the basis state |00>, |01>, |10>, and |11> can be denoted as a 4-dimensional vector:</p>
          <div class="equation-container">
            <p>\[|00> = \begin{pmatrix}
            1 \\
            0 \\
            0 \\
            0 \\
            \end{pmatrix}, |01> = \begin{pmatrix}
            0 \\
            1 \\
            0 \\
            0 \\
            \end{pmatrix}, |10> = \begin{pmatrix}
            0 \\
            0 \\
            1 \\
            0 \\
            \end{pmatrix}, |11> = \begin{pmatrix}
            0 \\
            0 \\
            0 \\
            1 \\
            \end{pmatrix} \]
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>These vectors form the basis for the 2-qubit system, and a quantum state of this system can be described as a linear combination of these basis vectors.
				For example, a qubit in a 2-qubit system can be expressed in a superposition of four basis states:</p>



          <div class="equation-container">
            <p>\[|\psi> = \alpha_{00}|00> + \alpha_{01}|01> + \alpha_{10}|10> + \alpha_{11}|11>\]</p>
          </div>
          <p>Here, \(\alpha_{00}, \alpha_{01}, \alpha_{10}\), and \(\alpha_{11}\) are quantum amplitudes of |00>, |01>, |10>, and |11>,
          The amplitudes of each quantum state satisfy the following equation. The probabilities of all quantum states are added to be equal to 1.</p>
          <p>\[|\alpha_{00}|^{2} + |\alpha_{01}|^{2} + |\alpha_{10}|^{2} + |\alpha_{11}|^{2} = 1\]</p>
