          <h3><b>3.3.4 Quantum full adder</b></h3>

			<p>The add cirucit use CNOT and CCNOT circuits so it is important to know the output state of the target qubit of CNOT and CCNOT.</p>
			<p>CNOT gate acts on two qubits, A as control qubit and B as target qubit. </p>
			<p>The output state of CNOT = \(|A>|A \oplus B>\)</p>
			<p>	It is easy to verify it through true table.
				When A is |0> as control qubit, the output of B(target qubit) is unchanged.
				When A is |1> as control qubit, the output state of B(target qubit) flips.
				Therefore, the output state of target is XOR between the state of A and B.
			</p>
			<p>CCNOT gate acts on three qubits, A and B as control qubits and C as target qubit.</p>
			<p>The output state of CCNOT = \(|(A \cdot B) \oplus C>\)</p>
			<p>We can see A and B as one qubit(\(A \cdot B\)) to control the target qubit so it is the same as CNOT gate.</p>

			<p>The quantum circuit of full adder as follows:</p>

		  <div class="figure-container">
			  <figure>
				  <img src="../../assets/fig/tutorial/circuit/Adder.png">
			  </figure>
		  </div>

			<p>We derive the math expression of \(C_{out}\) and S seperately. </p>
			<p></p>
			<div>In the stage 1,
				\[
					\begin{align}
					|S> &= |C_{in}> \\
					|A'> &= |A> \\
					|B'> &= |B> \\
					|C_{out}> &= |(AB) \oplus 0> = |AB>
					\end{align}
				\]
			</div>
			<div>
				In the state 2,
				\[
					\begin{align}
					|S> &= |C_{in}> \\
					|A'> &= |A> \\
					|B'> &= |A \oplus B> \\
					|C_{out}> &= |(AB) \oplus 0> = |AB>
					\end{align}
				\]
			</div>
			<div>
				In the stage 3,
				\[
					\begin{align}
					|S> &= |C_{in}> \\
					|A'> &= |A> \\
					|B'> &= |A \oplus B> \\
					|C_{out}> &= |AB \oplus [C_{in} \cdot (A \oplus B)]>
					\end{align}
				\]

				In the stage 4,

					\begin{align}
					|S> &= |C_{in} \oplus A \oplus B> \\
					|A'> &= |A> \\
					|B'> &= |A \oplus B> \\
					|C_{out}> &= |AB \oplus [C_{in} \cdot (A \oplus B)]>
					\end{align}

				In the final stage,
					\begin{align}
					|S> &= |C_{in} \oplus A \oplus B> \\
					|A'> &= |A> \\
					|B'> &= |A \oplus B> \\
					|C_{out}> &= |AB \oplus [C_{in} \cdot (A \oplus B)]>
					\end{align}
				<p>From the equation above, we can see the expression state of |S> equals the math one of S of a full adder.</p>

				<p>However, the expression of \(C_{out}\) is different from the one of a full adder. We can simply the expression to verify that they are the same one.</p>
				<div>
					\[
						\begin{align}
							|C_{out}> &= |AB \oplus [C_{in} \cdot (A \oplus B)]>
						\end{align}
					\]
					We can use X represents \(A \oplus B\), then


					\[
						\begin{align}

							|C_{out}> &= |AB \oplus [C_{in} \cdot X]> \\
									  &= |AB \overline{C_{in}X} + \overline{AB} C_{in}X>\\
									  &= |AB(\overline{C_{in}} + \overline{X}) + (\overline{A}+\overline{B})C_{in}X> \\
									  &= |AB(\overline{C_{in}} + \overline{A\oplus B}) + (\overline{A}+\overline{B})C_{in}\overline{A\oplus B})> \\
									  &= |AB(\overline{C_{in}} + AB + \overline{A}\overline{B}) + (\overline{A}+\overline{B})(A\overline{B} + \overline{A}B)C_{in}> \\
									  &= |AB\overline{C_{in}} + AB + (A\overline{B} + \overline{A}B)C_{in}> \\
									  &= |AB + (A\overline{B} + \overline{A}B)C_{in}> \\
									  &= |AB + (A\oplus B) \cdot C_{in}>
						\end{align}

					\]
					<p>We can see the expression of \(|C_{out}>\) equals the \(C_{out}\) of a full adder.
						Therefore, the quantum full adder circuit can have the function of adding two qubits with carry.</p>

			</div>

			<p>For example, before we use the quantum full adder, we need to prepare the input qubit for
				the value we want to compute. For example, when A = 0, B = 0, Cin = 1 and A = 1, B = 1, Cin = 1, we need
				to design quantum circuit to satisfy the condition. I used qiskit simulator to make
				the quantum circuit and got the measurement outcome of the circuit. The quantum circuit as follows:</p>
		<div class="figure-container">
			<figure>
				<img src="../../assets/fig/tutorial/circuit/adder_preparation_qiskit1.png">
			</figure>
		</div>
		<div class="figure-container">
			<figure>
				<img src="../../assets/fig/tutorial/circuit/adder_preparation_qiskit2.png">
			</figure>
		</div>

			<p>The first qubit |q0> is Cin, the second |q2> and third qubits |q3> are A and B, the last qubit |q4> is |0> as the input qubits.
				We prepared input quantum states, one is |A> = |B> = |0>,  |Cin> = |1>, and the other is |A> = |B> = |1>, |Cin> = |1>.
				In Qiskit, note the first qubit is the rightest one in the figure.
				The outcome in the figure is |0001> with the probability with 677/1024, and |0111> with 347/1024.

			</p>

		  </div>
		<div class="figure-container">
			<figure>
				<img src="../../assets/fig/tutorial/circuit/adder_qiskit2.png">
			</figure>
		</div>

			<p>In the figure, from the right to left, the first qubit of the final result is the sum of A and B, the second and third one are A and B,
				and the last one is the carry. </p>
			<p>In the figure, |0001> represents the carry is 0 and the sum of A and B is 1 when A = B = 0, and Cin = 1.
				Its probability is 653/1024 which is close to 677/1024.
				|1111> represents the carray is the carry is 1 and the sum of A and B is 1 when A = B = 1, and Cin = 1.
				Its probability is 371/1024 which is close to 647/1024.
				It means that the quantum circuit can perform the function of a full adder.
			</p>

			<p></p>
			<p>The preceding illustration described a one bit full adder. Now, consider the figure below,
			representing a two bit full adder composed of two such one bit adders, such as A = 01 and B = |11>.
				This conceptual framework
			can be extended to design quantum adders for systems involving multiple bits.</p>

		  <div class="figure-container">
			<figure>
				<img src="../../assets/fig/tutorial/circuit/Adder_N.png">
			</figure>
		  </div>

			<p>When 01 and 11 are as the input of a two bit full adder, it means that |A0> = |1>,
			|A1> = |0>, |B> = |1>, and |B>=|1>. The Cout of first adder is as the input Cin of the second adder.
				The output of |S0>, |S1>, and |Cout> represent the first bit and the second bit of Sum (from right to left),
			and the carry bit value. The sum of 01 and 11 equals 100 so |S0> = |0>, |S1 > = |0> and |Cout> = |1>.</p>

			<p>
				When multiple qubits add respectively, it only prepares the input qubits in superposition.
				When the sum of the 11 and 01, it prepares |A0> = |1>, |A1> = |1>, |B0> = |1>, and |B1> = |0>.
				when the sum of the 00 and 10, it prepares |A0> = |0>, |A1> = |0>, |B0> = |0>, and |B1> = |1>.

				Therefore, |A0>|B0>|A1>|B1> needs to be |1110> and |0001> in the superposition.

			</p>
			<p>From the outcome of qiskit, qubits are in the superposition with |01100100> and |0000010>(from the right to left in the figure).
				It illustrates that |A0>|B0>|A1>|B1> is in |1110> and |0001> with the probability of 326/1024 and 698/1024 respectively.

			<p>The outcome |S0>|A0>|B0>|S1>|A1>|B1>|Cout> in the figure is |0001010> and |0110101>(from the right to left in the figure).</p>
			<p>	|0001010> is |S0> = |0>, |A0> = |0>, |B0> = |0>, |S1> = |1>, |A1> = |0>, |B1> = |1>, |Cout> = |0>, so it means
				the sum of 00 and 10 equals 010.</p>
			<p>	|0110101> is |S0> = |0>, |A0> = |1>, |B0> = |1>, |S1> = |0>, |A1> = |1>, |B1> = |0>, |Cout> = |1>, so it means
				the sum of 11 and 01 equals 100.
