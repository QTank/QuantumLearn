        <h3><b>3.3.2 Quantum circuit for bell states</b></h3>
				<p>A Bell state, also known as an entangled state or EPR pair(Einsten-Podolsky-Rosen pair), is a specific
					type of entangled quantum states involving two qubits that are entangled. They exhibit the phenomenon of entanglement,
					where the state of one qubit is dependent on the state of the other, no matter how far they are.
				</p>
				<p><b>Bell states and Bell inequalities</b></p>
				<p>The concept of Bell states is closely associated with Bell inequalities, which were introduced by physicist John Bell in 1964.
				Bell inequalities provide a way to test whether the correlations observed between entangled particles can be explained by
				classical physics or if they require a quantum explanation. Violations of Bell inequalities indicate that the system can not
				be described by local hidden variable theory and confirm the presence of quantum entanglement.</p>
				<p><b>The four bell states</b></p>
				<p>There are four bell states, which are denoted as \(|\Phi^+>, |\Phi^->, |\Psi^+> \text{and} |\Psi^->\).
				These states are given by:</p>
				\[
					|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |00\rangle + |11\rangle \right)
				\]

				\[
					|\Phi^-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |00\rangle - |11\rangle \right)
				\]

				\[
					|\Psi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |01\rangle + |10\rangle \right)
				\]

				\[
					|\Psi^-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |01\rangle - |10\rangle \right)
				\]
				<p><b>Construct Bell States using quantum circuits</b></p>
				<p>Bell states can be constructed using a H gate and a CNOT gate:</p>
          <div class="figure-container">
              <figure>
                  <img src="../../assets/fig/tutorial/circuit/BellCircuit.png">
              </figure>
          </div>

				<p>1. Initial the input qubit |q0> = |0> and |q1> = |0>, </p>
				<p>2. Apply a H gate to the first qubit: creates a superposition, </p>
				\[
						|0>|0> \xrightarrow{H_{0}} H|0>|0> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0>+|1>)|0>
					\]
				<p>3. Apply a CNOT gate, with the first qubit as the control and the second qubit as the target:
				This entangles the two qubits, </p>
				\[
						\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0>+|1>)|0> \xrightarrow{CNOT_{01}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00> + |11>)
					\]
				<p>We can get The bell state \(|\Phi^+>\): </p>
				\[
						|\Phi^+> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00> + |11>)
				\]

			</div>
			<p>Once bell states are prepared, they can be used in various quantum protocols, including quantum teleportation,
			superdense coding, and quantum cryptography. </p>
